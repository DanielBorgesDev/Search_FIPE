# Search_FIPE
I would like to present my most recent project, an application developed in Flutter to search for information developed in vehicles using the FIPE number. This application is designed to provide an efficient and intuitive tool for users to quickly access vehicle valuation data.

Project description
The FIPE consultation application was developed to offer users a simple and accurate way to obtain information about the value of the vehicle market in Brazil. Using the powerful and versatile Flutter framework, the app offers a seamless and responsive user experience on Android and iOS devices.
